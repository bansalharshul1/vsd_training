# Day4 Pre-layout timing analysis and implortance of good clock tree

# Timing Modelling using delay Tables

Lef file had the info about the port information input out power and ground

Command to extract the lef: 

guidelines : input and outpur ports must lie on the intersection of the horizontal and vertical tracks

Width of Std cells should be in the odd multiples of track pitch

height of std cell should be in odd multiples of vertical pitch
